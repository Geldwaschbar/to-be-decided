- **The Parliament** decides on a law every day. It will decide on the law with the highest visibility. You can increase or decrease the visibility of a law by lobbying for or against it. Lobbying costs $100. Whenever a law is passed, it affects the parliament and stock market directly.
- **The stock market** represents your success in managing Evil Inc. Every day, your money will increase by 10% of the current stock market price. Money is the primary resource for influencing parliament.
- **The botnet** allows you to directly influence the media and public opinion. By distributing malware, your botnet grows. Posting memes makes your preferred party more popular in the eyes of the public. You can farm crypto to earn more money. When you use bribery, parliament will vote in favour of your laws more often.
